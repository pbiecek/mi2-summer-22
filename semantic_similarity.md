## Semantic similarity of tabular data

  
Name of the mentor: Katarzyna Wo≈∫nica
    
### Why the project is important?
    

In hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models, methods based on meta-learning, particularly static portfolios of algorithm configurations, are becoming increasingly applicable. These portfolios are optimized concerning the quality of model performance for previously performed experiments (meta-train datasets) but should assure good model performance on a new unknown dataset. The basic assumption of meta-training has been that we have no additional knowledge about the new dataset. So the meta-train was made up of very diverse datasets. In practical applications, however, this weakens the input too drastically - often, the goal is to perform optimization for tasks from a specific domain, e.g., medical tasks, and so we have some additional knowledge on input. Consolidated learning assumes the use of this information and that the purposeful definition of the composition of the meta-train collection only to sets having similar origin and set of explanatory variables will enhance the transfer of hyperparameter configurations between related prediction problems.

The project is oriented towards the key step of defining similarity between datasets using ontologies that provide a consistent way to label datasets within a specific domain. The use of ontologies will facilitate the definition of semantic similarity of explanatory variables and the use of knowledge of the structure of datasets for meta-learning. This is a novel alternative approach to the statistical methods used so far to assess the structure of datasets.

  

### What shall be completed by the end of the project?
    
-   Collection of annotated medical problem datasets with trained machine learning models - boosting models
    
-   Analysis of transfer of optimal hyperparameters between the collected datasets in the form of a draft of an article
    
-   Verification of whether it is possible to automate the process of annotating datasets for machine learning application - overview of existing tools (optional: outline of package to data annotation for ML)
    

### What inter/interns will learn during the summer project
    

-   knowledge of medical database ontologies
    
-   designing machine learning experiments and reporting the results
    
-   acquaintance with the subject of meta-learning and autoML
    

### Requirements:

-   R/Python
    
-   basic knowledge of machine learning modelling
    

  

### Follow-up

After the internship, it is possible to cooperate on writing down a short research article based on the experimental results. The topic can also be later used for a diploma thesis.
