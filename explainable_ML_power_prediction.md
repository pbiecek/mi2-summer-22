## Abstract

Proposing a statistical hypothesis testing procedure to test a specific hypothesis is a familiar process in statistics. The last step of this process is to investigate the performance of the proposed test and to report the results obtained. There are criteria such as Type 1 error probability, power of the test, adjusted power, intrinsic power, penalized power are used to measure the performance of the test in Monte-Carlo simulation studies ([Cavus et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2019.1588310)). However, the problem in the studies on the investigating performance of the statistical test is that they cannot be compared due to the inconsistency of the configurations used in the simulation studies. In this case, researchers need to configurate an additional simulation setup, which is not a practical way.

In this project, machine learning models are used to model the relationship between the factors affecting the performance of the test, similar to the idea in [Chipman and Bingham (2021)](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2111.13737), which is thought to be a more practical way. Thus, the performance of the tests for any specific situation can be estimated without the need to configure simulations. Moreover, the another problem is using the ambiguity in expressions for reporting the performance of the test which is discussed in [Blanca et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0918-2) is solved by using the explainable artificial intelligence methods to explore the behavior of the models. 


### Why is the project important?

Monte-Carlo simulation studies is the frequently used method to investigate the performance of statistical tests, however they have many limitations. The fact that it is only conductable for a limited range and the ambiguous expressions used in their interpretation make it difficult to compare and summarize the results of these studies. Due to such problems, it is clear that an alternative approach is needed to investigate the performance of tests. This study is important in terms of being a solution to the aforementioned problem.


### What shall be completed by the end of the project?

* ML models are used to model the relationship between the factors affecting the performance of the test which is thought to be a more practical way.  

* The another problem is using the ambiguity in expressions for reporting the performance of the test is solved by using the explainable artificial intelligence methods to explore the behavior of the models. 


### What will the intern(s) learn during the summer project?

* Learning the statistical test performance measures 
* Standardizing the Monte-Carlo simulation configurations
* Training tree-based ML models by using AutoML tools.
* Explaining the ML model behaviors by using the XAI methods.


## Follow-up

* Collaborating on writing a research paper / a conference proceeding.
* The topic can be used for the diploma thesis.
